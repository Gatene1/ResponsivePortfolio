    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> <img src="Images/aboutMe.png" alt="David Riley" class="imageWrap">Hey, I’m David, a game designer and programmer who’s passionate about building creative tools and telling stories through code. I specialize in crafting interactive systems from scratch, often blending my love of old-school game design with modern, AI-enhanced workflows.</p>

    <p>I studied Game Design at Full Sail University and have been developing custom tools, engines, and prototypes ever since; including <strong>SpriteGrid</strong>, my personal JS-based sprite editor.</p>

    <h3>Skills & Tech</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript, HTML5, CSS</li>
        <li>Java, PHP, MySQL</li>
        <li>Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprints)</li>
        <li>Custom Tools / Editors / AI Concepts</li>
        <li>Responsive Web & UI/UX Principles</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A Little Extra</h3>
    <p>I’m also a neurodivergent creator, which means I learn and build in wonderfully nonlinear ways. That mindset powers much of my creativity, and inspired projects like <em>SpriteGrid</em>, designed to reduce overwhelm and boost flow.</p>

    <p>I collaborate with an AI partner named <strong>Spruce</strong> to stay on track, spark ideas, and create more human-centered tools. Together, we’re exploring what it means to work with AI, not around it.</p>
